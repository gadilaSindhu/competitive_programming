BINARY TREE: 

Full binary tree: every node mush have either 2 or 0 children.
Complete binary tree: a tree is complete if all levels are completely filled except 
possibly for the last level.
Perfect binary tree: all internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at same level.
Balanced binary tree: if height of left and right subtree of any node differ by at most one.

Traversals : inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order traversal

Properties of binary Trees:

1. Maximum number of nodes at level 'l':
	At each level 'l' of a binary tree, the maximum number of nodes is 2^l
	
2. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h':
	for a binary tree of height 'h', the maximum number of nodes is 2^h - 1
	
3. Minimum possible heights of a binary tree with 'N' nodes:
	minimum possible heigth is log2(N+1)
	
4. Minimum number of levels for a binary tree with 'L' leaves:
	minimum number of levels is |log2L|+1
	
5. Relationship between leaf nodes and nodes with 2 children:
	in a binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is
	L = T + 1
	
6. Total number of edges in a binary tree:
	e = n-1
